# Salary Prediction Based on Country, Race, and Gender

This is a machine learning project that predicts a person salary based on factors such as country, race, and gender. The data was sourced from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudheerp2147234/salary-dataset-based-on-country-and-race) (which has since been deleted).

The exact features of the dataset are age, gender, education level, job title, years of experience, salary, country, and race. The EDA conducted in this project mostly focused on race and gender.

The Jupyter Notebook contains the data preprocessing, EDA, and modeling processes. I used a Random Forest Regressor which resulted in an R2 score of about 97.64%.
